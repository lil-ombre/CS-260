Bag of Marbles design:
Idea:
My idea to have a program that could resemble a bag of marbles would be very simple.
I would design the program like a game that would let the user interact with the bag of marbles.
i would set up a menu where it would welcome the user into the program and ask them to choose an action to perform.
One option would be to add marbles and another to remove the marble and an option that closes the program.
I would also want a line that displays whats in the bag to see the program working.

Implementation:
I will use a switch statement that lets the user add a marble, remove a marble, and close the program.
I will also put the the whole program in a while loop to keep the game going until the user closes the program.
I will use a vector to act as the bag of marbles since it will hold variables(marbles).
To remove a marble I will use the pop_back function and to add a marble I will use the push_back function.
To display the bag I will use a for loop that displays whats in the vector.

Im not very good with designs so pls let me know what you think. :)
